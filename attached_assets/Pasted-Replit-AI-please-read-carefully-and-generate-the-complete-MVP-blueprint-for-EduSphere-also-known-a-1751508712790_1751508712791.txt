Replit AI, please read carefully and generate the complete MVP blueprint for EduSphere (also known as Madrasti).
Preserve all existing features exactly as-is (role-based dashboards, multilingual interface, dark/light theme, Firebase backend), and extend the project with the following Morocco-specific modules, fields, and logic.
Student management and editing functionality must be strictly accessible to the Administration role only.

track (e.g. science, literary, technical)

boursier (true/false) + scholarship amount

üßÆ Grading & Exam Modules (0‚Äì20 Moroccan System)
Implement a grading system that includes:

All student management features should remain exclusive to the Administrator role.
